Technical Implementation
Unit of Work pattern properly implemented
Repository pattern with generic base and specialized implementations
AutoMapper integration for clean object mapping
Comprehensive logging throughout the application
Proper configuration management in Program.cs
I used Domain-driven design principles and service layer with proper business logic encapsulation
To run the application just run dotnet ef database update --project ../StackBuld.Infrastructure --startup-project . --context ECommerceDbContext
Ensure you update the appsettings to fit your current mssql Server name
Tech stack choice is dotnet
